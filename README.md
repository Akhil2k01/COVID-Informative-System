# COVID-Informative-System
CIS is a Database/Web project.

This is a web based application used to find the vaccinations and quarantine locations for the users.

This system is used by the admin to maintain the patients information, who got vacciated, who has registered for vaccination/quarantine and who yet has to get vaccinated is provided for the admin.

This application provides a smooth and interactive interface which can be easily used by common people.

I used HTML for interface, CSS for styling, little JavaScript for some interactions and php for server scripts.

For phpMyAdmin (MySQL database and Apache Server) i used Xampp : https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

For database operations I used SQL language.

And for IDE I used VS Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/
